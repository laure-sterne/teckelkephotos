## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

The way to manage frustration to not programming. During this project, I got problems with my computer what stopped me to coding. I had a lot of difficulties to run Docker, install the right version of composer and many others worries.

To continue participating in the project, I did research and learn to think about a solution without testing it. Of course, sometimes I take the lead to coding through other's computer offering me a break.
I think this project improves my capacities to do investigation.
